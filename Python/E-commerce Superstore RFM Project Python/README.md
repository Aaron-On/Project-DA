# I. Introduction 
## Context

SuperStore Company is a global retail company with a large customer database. On the occasion of Christmas and the New Year, the Marketing department plans to run marketing campaigns to express gratitude to customers who have supported the company over time. Additionally, they aim to identify potential customers and convert them into loyal customers.

However, the Marketing department has not yet segmented the customers for this year due to the large dataset, which cannot be processed manually as in previous years. Therefore, they are seeking assistance from the Data Analysis department to solve the customer segmentation problem and deploy tailored marketing programs for each customer segment.

The Marketing Director has proposed using the RFM model. Previously, when the company was smaller, the team could calculate and classify customers using Excel. However, with the current data volume, they hope the Data Analysis department can build an automated deployment flow for segmentation evaluation using Python programming.

# II. RFM Analysis

Identifying customer segments is beneficial for selecting profitable customers and developing customer loyalty. RFM (Recency-Frequency-Monetary) analysis is a simple technique for behavior based customer segmentation. It is used to determine quantitatively which customers are the most valuable ones by examining:

- How recently a customer has purchased (recency)
- How often they purchase (frequency)
- How much the customer spends (monetary)
