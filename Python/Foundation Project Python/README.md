# I. Introduction
Learning through different kind of lessons, gaining certain knowleadge about datatype, condition syntax, function, loop(if, else). Especially computational thinking is the requirement of this project. The goal of this project is buliding strong foundation skills in Python Programming by solving practical problems. Moreover, it will be useful for develop problem-solving abilities, apply computaional thinking as well as gain hands-on experience with core program concepts
## Context

In today's world, data and programming are essential tools to analyze and automate tasks. This project is designed to simulate real-world challenges where you will:

- Identify and use suitable data types for various problems.
- Learn to define and use functions effectively for each issue
- Implement loops and apply logical thinking to solve problems efficiently.
- Develop a Computational Thinking mindset to approach challenges systematically.

# II. Process

### Practice 1: Create a function to find which word occurs the most ? Check this function with the following paragraph
- "Friendship is one of the most important things in life. Probably everybody has a few close friends who you met at school or university. Nevertheless, I think that our life does consists of more significant things even than friendship. For example, family and self-realisation are vital necessities of life at all times. Firstly, a family has a significant influence on both upbringing and education of a child since early age."

### Practice 2:  Count the unique words of the following text
- "Friendship is one of the greatest bonds anyone can ever wish for. Lucky are those who have friends they can trust. Friendship is a devoted relationship between two individuals. They both feel immense care and love for each other. Usually, a friendship is shared by two people who have similar interests and feelings".

### Practice 3: Find the number or prime number from the following list
- [1, 7, 6, 9, 13, 21, 27]

### Practice 4: Check if these two couples of sentences (Sentence 1 & 2, Sentence 3 & 4) are anagrams or not
- Sentence 1 = "listen to the silent whispers"

- Sentence 2 = "silent whispers to the listen"

- Sentence 3 = "listen to the silent night"

- Sentence 4 = "silent whispers to the listen"

### Practice 5: (Optional)  Anna is submitting a requirement on a platform. Howerver, there are limitations about the number of words and number of characters for the submission. Particularly, the number of word should be under 50 words, and number of character should be under 200 characters.

Please help Anna create a function to do this and check this function with the following submissions !
- Submission 1: "I am very excited about the opportunity to work with your company. My skills in data analysis and programming make me confident that I would be a valuable addition to your team. I look forward to the chance to contribute and grow with your company.

- Submission 2: "I recently bought this product, and I must say, I'm really impressed. The quality is exceptional, and it works just as advertised. I especially appreciate the ease of use, which makes it perfect for both beginners and experts. I would definitely recommend it to others who are looking for something similar."

# III. Outcome
By completing this project, you will:
- Understand how to apply suitable data types in real-world practice.
- Learn to define and use functions effectively, along with loops for processing data.
- Strengthen your Computational Thinking skills to solve real-world problems.

This experience will not only improve your coding skills but also enhance your ability to break down complex problems and implement efficient solutions.
